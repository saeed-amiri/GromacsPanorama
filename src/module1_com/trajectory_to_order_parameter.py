Calculating Order Parameter for All Residues in a System

This script utilizes `trajectory_residue_extractor.py` for determining
the order parameter of every residue in a given system. It involves
reading the system's trajectory data, calculating the order parameter
for each residue, and recording these values for subsequent analysis.
This analysis includes examining how the order parameter of residues
varies over time and in different spatial directions.

Key Points:

1. Utilization of Unwrapped Trajectory:
   Similar to the approach in 'com_pickle', this script requires the
   use of an unwrapped trajectory to ensure accurate calculations.

2. Data to Save:
   Simply saving the index of residues is insufficient for later
   identification of their spatial locations. Therefore, it's crucial
   to store the 3D coordinates (XYZ) along with each residue's order
   parameter. However, recalculating the center of mass (COM) for each
   residue would be computationally expensive.

3. Leveraging com_pickle:
   To optimize the process, the script will utilize 'com_pickle',
   which already contains the COM and index of each residue in the
   system. This allows for the direct calculation of the order
   parameter for each residue based on their respective residue index,
   without the need for additional COM computations.

4. Comprehensive Order Parameter Calculation:
   Rather than limiting the calculation to the order parameter in the
   z-direction, this script will compute the full tensor of the order
   parameter, providing a more detailed and comprehensive understanding
   of the residues' orientation.

This methodological approach ensures a balance between computational
efficiency and the thoroughness of the analysis.
