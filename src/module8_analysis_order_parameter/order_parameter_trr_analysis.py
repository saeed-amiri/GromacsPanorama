Computing the order parameter from the trajectory file.
The script reads the trajectory file frame by frame with MDAnalysis
and computes the order parameter for them.
The script computes the order paramters:
    - For water and oil molecules, it should be able to compute along
        the z-axis.
    - For the surfactant molecules, it should be able to compute along
        the y-axis, also only at the main interface; by the main
        interface, we mean the interface between the water and oil
        molecules where the must of surfactant molecules are located,
        and in case there is a nanoparticle in the system, the
        interface where the nanoparticle is located.

The steps will be as follows:
    - Read the trajectory file
    - Read the topology file
    - Select the atoms for the order parameter calculation
    - Compute the order parameter
    - Save the order parameter to a xvg file

Since we already have computed the interface location, we can use that
to compute the order parameter only at the interface.

input files:
    - trajectory file
    - topology file
    - interface location file (contact.xvg)
output files:
    - order parameter xvg file along the z-axis
    - in the case of the surfactant molecules, we save a data file
        based on the grids of the interface, looking at the order 
        parameter the value and save the average value of the order
        and contour plot of the order parameter.
        This will help us see the order parameter distribution in the
        case of an NP and see how the order parameter changes around
        the NP.
