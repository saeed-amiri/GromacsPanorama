"""
densities_around_np.py

This module is designed to calculate various properties such as
densities, radial distribution functions (rdf), and cumulative
distribution functions (cdf) for ions or other residues in the vicinity
of a nanoparticle. Unlike the 'oda_density_around_np.py' script in
module4, which focuses on two-dimensional analyses,
'densities_around_np.py' extends these computations to three dimensions.
This enhancement allows for a more comprehensive and spatially detailed
understanding of the distribution and interactions of ions or residues
around nanoparticles in a 3D space.

Functions:
    - calculate_density: Computes the density distribution of ions or
        residues around the nanoparticle in 3D.

    - compute_rdf: Calculates the radial distribution function, providing
    insights into the spatial distribution and local ordering of particles.

    - compute_cdf: Determines the cumulative distribution function,
    offering a cumulative perspective of particle distribution up to a
    certain radius.

This script facilitates a deeper exploration of the structural and
dynamic properties of systems involving nanoparticles and their
surrounding environment in three-dimensional space.
