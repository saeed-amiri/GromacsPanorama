"""
charge_analysis_interface_np.py

This script is designed to perform charge analysis on nanoparticles or
interfaces. It reads relevant data and computes charge distributions,
identifying key charge-related properties and interactions. This
analysis aids in understanding the electrostatic characteristics of
nanoparticles and interfaces in various environments.

Functions:
- read_data: Loads and preprocesses the input data.
- compute_charge_distribution: Calculates the charge distribution on
    the nanoparticle or interface.
- analyze_interactions: Analyzes electrostatic interactions based on
    charge distributions.
- generate_report: Summarizes the findings in a structured report.

Usage:
Run this script with the required data files to obtain a detailed
analysis of charges on nanoparticles or interfaces.
