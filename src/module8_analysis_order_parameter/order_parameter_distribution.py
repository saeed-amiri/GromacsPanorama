Order Parameter Analysis Procedure:

The analysis of order parameters in our Python script is structured to
proceed as follows:

Frame-by-Frame Analysis:
    For each frame in the simulation, we will conduct a separate
    analysis.

Residue Type Processing:
    Within each frame, we will categorize and process the data according
    to different residue types.

Identifying Residues in Bins:
    For each residue type, we'll identify the residues that fall into
    a specified bin. This step involves determining which residues'
    indices are within the boundaries of each bin.

Calculating Average Order Parameters: Once the relevant residues for
each bin and frame are identified, we will calculate the average order
parameter. This involves averaging the order parameters of all selected
residues within each specific frame and bin.
